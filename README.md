## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression Summary](/resources/lm_summary.png)
* The vehicle length and ground clearance are least likely to provide random amounts of variance.  
* Because the P-value is less than 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the slope is not 0. 
*  The linear regression predicts mpg with 70.8% accuracy because the r value is .708.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
![ Total Summary](/resources/total_summary.png)
![Lot Summary](/resources/lot_summary.png)
According to the data, Lot 3 does not meet the requirements that the suspension coil must not exceed a variance of 100 pounds per square inch because the Variance of Lot 3 is 170.30. Overall, the 3 lots combined do meet this requirement. When considering all lots the variance is 67.30.
