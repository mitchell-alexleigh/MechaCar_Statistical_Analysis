## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression Summary](/resources/lm_summary.png)
* The vehicle length and ground clearance are least likely to provide random amounts of variance.  
* Because the P-value is less than 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the slope is not 0. 
*  The linear regression predicts mpg with 70.8% accuracy because the r value is .708.
